Display or print the total number of solutions.
Hint: Check column, row, and both diagonals when placing each queen.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sudoku Validator
Goal: Verify whether a given 9√ó9 Sudoku grid is valid.
Requirements:
Input: 2-D list of integers (0‚Äì9), where 0 represents an empty cell.
Ensure each row, column, and 3√ó3 subgrid contains no duplicate numbers 1‚Äì9.
Print ‚ÄúValid Sudoku‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvalid Sudoku‚Äù with reasons (e.g., duplicate in row 4).
Do not attempt to solve the puzzle‚Äîonly validate.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Word Ladder Step Counter
Goal: Find the minimum number of single-letter transformations to change a start word into a target word, where each intermediate word must exist in a given dictionary.
Requirements:
Inputs: start_word, end_word, and a list/set of valid words of equal length.
Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.
Output: Minimum steps and one possible transformation sequence.

4Ô∏è‚É£ 0/1 Knapsack with Memoization
Goal: Maximize value of items selected without exceeding weight capacity.
Requirements:
Inputs: arrays of weights[], values[], and integer capacity.
Implement recursive solution with memoization (dynamic programming).
Output: Maximum achievable value and which items are chosen.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Sort Implementation
Goal: Sort a list of numbers using merge sort without using built-in sort.
Requirements:
Accept an unsorted list of integers.
Implement the divide and conquer algorithm: split, sort sublists, merge.
Show the list before and after sorting.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Trie (Prefix Tree) Construction
Goal: Store words in a Trie and support prefix search.
Requirements:
Implement a Trie class with methods: insert(word), search(word), and starts_with(prefix).
Insert a given list of words, then allow user queries to test both full-word and prefix lookups.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Traversal (DFS & BFS)
Goal: Traverse a graph using both Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.
Requirements:
Represent the graph as a dictionary: {node: [neighbors]}.
Implement separate functions for DFS (recursive or stack) and BFS (queue).
Output the visiting order starting from a chosen node.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Common Subsequence (Dynamic Programming)
Goal: Find the longest subsequence common to two strings (not necessarily contiguous).
Requirements:
Input: Two strings.
Use a 2-D dynamic programming table.
Output: Length of the LCS and one valid subsequence.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Matrix Multiplication
Goal: Multiply two matrices without external libraries like NumPy.
Requirements:
Validate that the number of columns of Matrix A equals the number of rows of Matrix B.
Use nested loops to compute the product.
Print the resulting matrix in a clean tabular format.

üîü Permutations Generator
Goal: Generate all possible permutations of a string or list.
Requirements:
Input: A string or list of unique elements.
Use recursion to produce every permutation.
Print the count and display each permutation.







üåç Real-Life / Scenario-Based Projects (10)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mini E-Commerce Backend
Goal: Simulate a simple cart system in the console.
Requirements:
Maintain a product catalog (dictionary: product ‚Üí price).
Features: add/remove products, update quantities, show cart, calculate subtotal + tax.
Persist the cart during the session and display final invoice.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Room Simulation
Goal: Imitate a multi-user chat in a single console session.
Requirements:
Users can join/leave and send messages.
Store data as {username: [list_of_messages]}.
Provide commands like /join, /leave, /send <msg>, /show <user>.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Flight Seat Allocation System
Goal: Manage bookings for economy and business class.
Requirements:
Represent seats (e.g., 6 rows √ó 4 columns).
Allow booking only if seat is free and class matches.
Prevent double booking and show a seating chart after each operation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Loan EMI Calculator
Goal: Compute monthly EMI and generate a payment schedule.
Requirements:
Inputs: principal, annual interest rate, and tenure in months.
Display monthly EMI, total interest, and remaining balance after each payment.
Use the standard EMI formula and loops for amortization.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Restaurant Order Management
Goal: Handle multiple table orders simultaneously.
Requirements:
Menu stored as {item: price}.
For each table, allow add/remove dishes, print individual bills, and track total revenue.
Include taxes and optional service charge.
